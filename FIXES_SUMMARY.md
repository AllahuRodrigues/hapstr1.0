# HapSTR NYC Platform - Issues Fixed

## 🐛 Issues Addressed

### 1. ✅ Google Maps Infinite Loading
**Problem**: Google Maps was stuck on "Loading NYC Google Maps 3D..." forever
**Solution**:
- Enhanced error handling and logging in `src/components/google-maps-3d.tsx`
- Added proper initialization sequence with DOM readiness check
- Improved error messages to show specific failure reasons
- Added console logging for debugging API loading steps

### 2. ✅ Eagle Map Using California Data
**Problem**: Eagle Map was pulling California/Zillow data instead of NYC PLUTO data
**Solution**:
- Modified `src/components/eagle-map.tsx` to use NYC PLUTO API (`/api/nyc-property`)
- Updated `searchPropertiesInBounds()` to fetch real NYC property data
- Added fallback to NYC demo data when real data unavailable
- Removed all California/Zillow references and replaced with NYC-specific data

### 3. ✅ Missing Close Buttons on Property Cards
**Problem**: Property cards had poor/missing close functionality
**Solution**:
- Added prominent X close buttons in top-right corner of all property cards
- Enhanced close functionality with hover effects and proper styling
- Made close buttons accessible with aria-labels
- Added both "Close Details" button and X icon for better UX

### 4. ✅ Enhanced Property Information for Clients
**Problem**: Property cards didn't show the most important information for real estate clients
**Solution**:
- **Financial Focus**: Highlighted estimated value and rent in prominent colored boxes
- **Key Metrics**: Added assessed value, estimated market value, and monthly rent estimates
- **Property Intelligence**: Organized zoning, building class, square footage, and lot size
- **Professional Layout**: Used real estate industry-standard information hierarchy
